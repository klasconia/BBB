VERSION 0.2
The second release of BBB.js includes functionality for creating video chapters. A chapter is defined as having a title, source URL, start time, and end time. BBB.js also includes functionality that dynamically populates a "table of contents" when a new chapter is created. This table of contents will include a URL for the chapter title. If clicked the selected chapter will play from start to end time. A "Play All" URL will also be generated. If clicked all chapters will play in sequential order. (Order as they were added) BBB.js also includes functions to serialize a Bookmark object to JSON, and convert JSON back into a Bookmark object.

Also included is a watermark over the video, statistic tracking, and capability to recommend videos. Data storage may be on the computer using HTML5 local storage or on a remote server which is queried for data. Subtitles are supported in both SRT and TTXT formats.

NOTES
- The Demos folder contains a working demo that uses the BBB chaptering functionality with the video.js library
- Need to find a way to stop/control looping once all chapters are done

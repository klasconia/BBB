VERSION 0.3

The third release of BBB.js includes functionality for creating video chapters. A chapter is defined as having a title, source URL, start time, and end time.
BBB.js also includes functionality that dynamically populates a "table of contents" when a new chapter is created. This table of contents will include a URL
for the chapter title. If clicked the selected chapter will play from start to end time. A "Play All" URL will also be generated. If clicked all chapters will
play in sequential order. (Order as they were added) BBB.js also includes functions to serialize a Bookmark object to JSON, and convert JSON back into a Bookmark
object.

Also included is a watermark over the video, statistic tracking, and capability to recommend videos. Data storage may be on the computer using HTML5 local
storage or on a remote server which is queried for data. Subtitles are supported in both SRT and TTXT formats.

New in the third release is the inclusion of metadata generation for use with the popcorn library. A form is displayed dynamically on the web page to fill
and create entries in a timeline of semantic content. Data types are selectable by drop down box, start and end times use a button to set the current point
in the video as start or end. This same start/end button behavious has been carried over the existing "New Chapter" functionality.
